# How do I get the URL Code?
Split 'https://onyolo.com/m/' and keep the part that's after that
Split '?' and whatever is behind it is the URL Code
For example, take this URL: https://onyolo.com/m/123456789?w=Send%20honest%20messages%20%F0%9F%98%87
Split everything that's after 'https://onyolo.com/m/' which will bring you to '123456789?w=Send%20honest%20messages%20%F0%9F%98%87' in our example.
Next, split the '?' in our example which will bring you '123456789' which is the URL Code.
